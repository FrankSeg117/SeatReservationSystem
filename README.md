## Data Structures Proyect

Welcome to our humble repository, here you will see our source code for our course proyect of our data structures class.

## What is this proyect?

In this proyect we implemented a system for seat reservation in a football stadium. This system manages the available seats, client reservations and a wait list for a section that may be full. The system allows an user to reserve an available seat, cancel reservations, and allows to see the availability of free seats.
