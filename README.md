## Main course Data Structures Project

Welcome to our humble repository. Here, you will see the source code for our course project for our data structures class.

## What is this project?

In this project, we implemented a system for seat reservation in a football stadium. This system manages the available seats, client reservations, and a waitlist for a section that may be full. The system allows a user to reserve an available seat, cancel reservations, and see the availability of free seats.
