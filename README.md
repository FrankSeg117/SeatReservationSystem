## Main course Data Structures Project

Welcome to our humble repository. Here, you will see the source code for our course project for our data structures class.

## What is this project?

In this project, we implemented a system for seat reservation in a football stadium. This system manages the available seats, client reservations, and a waitlist for a section that may be full. The system allows a user to reserve an available seat, cancel reservations, and see the availability of free seats. 

##Key Details:

##Stadium Sections and Pricing:  

Field Level: Premium seats ($300), Capacity: 500  
Main Level: Good view seats ($120), Capacity: 1,000  
Grandstand Level: Upper-level seats ($45), Capacity: 2,000  

##Core Features:  
Seat Reservation: Allows customers to book available seats.  
Waitlist Management: Adds customers to a waitlist for full sections.  
Cancel Reservation: Frees up seats, allowing the next person on the waitlist to reserve them.  
Availability Check: Shows available sections and allows customer selection.  

##Technical Implementation:  

##Data Structures:  
Set: For available seats.  
LinkedList: For reservation history.  
HashMap: To associate customers with their seats.  
Stack: To support an undo feature for reservations and cancellations.  
Queue: To manage the waitlist for full sections.
